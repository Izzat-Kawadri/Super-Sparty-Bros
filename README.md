## Overview
![Screenshot Image](/Screenshot.png)
**Super-Sparty-Bros** is a 2D platformer game developed in Unity3D as part of my game development training. It showcases the skills I've learned throughout the course. The game is inspired by the classic *Super Mario Bros* game and serves as a final project for the course I attended.

 In this game, you control a character named **Sparty**, who must navigate through challenging levels, avoiding enemies, collecting coins and hearts, and progressing to the next level by 
 reaching the end of each stage. The project was developed as a demonstration of my understanding of 2D game mechanics, Unity3D game engine, and game design principles.
